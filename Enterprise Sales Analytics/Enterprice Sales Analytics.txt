Project : Enterprice Sales Analytics

Step 1: Create Database
Create a new database named SalesDB (or any name you prefer).
This database will contain all project tables, triggers, and queries.

Step 2: Create Tables
Create core tables:
Products → holds product details (price, stock, category)
Customers → holds customer & region reference
Regions → holds region master
Sales → stores each sale record
Sales_Audit → tracks sale modifications

Step 3: Insert Sample Data
Insert a few sample records in all tables:
5–6 products (Electronics, Furniture, etc.)
5 customers (each linked to a region)
4–6 regions
10+ sales transactions

Step 4 : Create Triggers
Create a trigger to update stock automatically when a sale is made.
Create another trigger to audit changes in sales (insert/update/delete).

Step 5: Write Analytical Queries
Query 1: Total Sales & Profit per Region
Query 2: Top Products by Profit
Query 3: Year-over-Year Growth
Query 4: Customer Lifetime Value
Query 5: Dynamic Pivot Report by Region & Category
